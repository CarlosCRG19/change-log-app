<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This app allows a product manager or engineer to post projects/products updates for the team to see. This helps the team to keep track of the timelines of each one of them and show the stakeholders the progress made.

### User Stories
For planning purposes, the project is divided into User Stories which according to Martin Fowler are "chunks of desired behavior of a software system". They help prioritize work and identify the business value of each of the features to be developed.

1. _As a user I want to create, update and delete projects to carry out the recording of progress and so that other users can access them_.

2. _As a user I want to see a list of all projects in the main page of the app so that I can select them and access their details_.

3. _As a user I want to post project updates so that the team and stakeholders can see the progress made_.

4. _As a user I want to filter projects by name, date of publication or creator so that I can quickly find the project that I am looking for_.

5. _As a user I want to paginate over the list of all projects so that I can easily go through them without looking at a lot of information at once_.

6. _As a user I want to authenticate myself so that I can access all the functionalities of the app_.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
The interactions between business entities can be describe in an ERD. It is very simple but serves its illustration purpose.
